# Biopython Program to retrieve multiple FASTA sequence from accession no. of genes/proteins
This Biopython script simplifies the retrieval of protein and gene sequences using accession numbers. Hereâ€™s how it works:
# Setup:
Install Biopython using **pip install biopython**
Replace **____@gmail.com** with your actual email address in the script.
# Usage:
Create a text file (protein_accession_no.txt) containing accession numbers (one per line).
Run the script.
It fetches the corresponding fasta sequences from the NCBI protein database.
The sequences are saved in an output file (output_sequences.fasta).
# Benefits:
Researchers can efficiently retrieve multiple fasta sequences without manual searching.
Ideal for projects requiring analysis of more than one protein or gene sequence.
I developed this tool during my in silico vaccine design research for malaria, where I needed to analyze over 10 protein fasta files and cross-reference them with blast results.
